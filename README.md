# :clipboard: ToDo List

## Project

This app was developed to accomplish the first challenge of the React module from Rocketseat's Ignite course.
The goal here is to apply the main React concepts such as:

- State
- immutability of state
- Lists and Keys
- Props
- Components

That being said, with this app you can add/delete/mark as complete tasks in a list.
You can see the count of how many tasks were added and how many are marked as completed.
